# ExilePearl
Whenever a player kills another player with an ender pearl in their hotbar the killed player will be banished to the nether, and will have no way to escape. This act of banishing is called "pearling". It is what allows players to enforce their own rules and facilitates high risk combat. When pearled the player will spawn in the nether where they will have to live until they are either released by their captor, stolen and released by their allies or destroyed. A player can broadcast the location of their pearl to a group by performing the command /ep broadcast followed by the group name.

A list of all pearled players can also be viewed by performing the command /ep showall.

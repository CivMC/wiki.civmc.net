# HiddenOre
Every time a block that could contain ores is broken there's a chance ores will spawn around the player. Ores spawned this way depend on the Y level with spawn rates similar to vanilla ore distribution. So mining can be done at the same y-level for every ore like you'd do in vanilla Minecraft. Diamond ores only spawn in veins.

# Finale
Finale is a plugin that changes combat mechanics on the server. Mainly reverting pvp to pre 1.8 changes, meaning players are again able to spam click during combat. On CivMC, there is a 9 cps (clicks per second) limit, to prevent autoclickers from being used. Among other things, it also adds golden apple cooldowns, pearl usage cooldowns, and adjusts the vanilla health potions to provide 6 hearts of healing as apposed to the usual 3.

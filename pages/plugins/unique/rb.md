# Realistic Biomes
Realistic Biomes is a plugin that gives each biome their own crops and trees with much longer grow times, making farming a lot more in depth or "realistic" as the name would suggest. No more can you grow cocoa beans on the north pole, or spruce trees in the desert. This is important for the economy of the server, making it so that no one person can grow it all on their small island but instead forcing expansion or trade amongst nations and players. Thus also making XP much harder to acquire on your own, forcing cooperation among players even more so to achieve higher states of play.

# Brewery
Brewery is a plugin that allows players to produce alcoholic drink, foods and even drugs that can have unique effects on the player who drinks them. The recipes to produce these drinks are not given out however, which means that players have to experiment with the ingredients and hints given below to find them, or get the recipes from those who have already. 

## Setting up
Setting up a brewery is very easy and only requires 3 separate things, all of which play a different part in the brewing process. These are as described below

![Cauldron example](./media/Cauldron.png)

### Cauldron
First up is the start of all brews. A Cauldron placed above fire, lava, a magma block or a campfire will allow you to use it for brewing, simply add some water to the cauldron and right click your ingredients in. You'll know the cooking process has started when the item disappears from your hand, and swirling potion particles come out of the cauldron.

You can right click a clock on the cauldron to see how long it has been cooking for in minutes. Use this to time your recipes. 

### Distilling
Second is a brewing stand, with the odd addition of placing 1 glowstone dust in the top slot, like so:

![Distilling setup](./media/Distilling.png)

Brews taken out of the cauldron and put below the glowstone dust will be distilled. (The glowstone dust does not get used up) Every cycle of the downward arrow counts as 1 distill run. The brew will display how many times it has been distilled while hovering over it with you mouse. (1 distill run takes 40 seconds)

*Note that not all brews require you to distill them, this is an aspect you must experiment with. 

### Aging
Aging is done in barrels, these are simple multi block structures made out of wood, with a sign on them reading: "Barrel"

There are 2 versions. a small one which can hold and age 9 brews, and a large one which can hold and age a single chest's worth (27) see examples below: 



| Small Barrel | Large Barrel | Different kind of wood |
|:------------:|:------------:|:----------------------:|
|     ![Small Barrel](./media/Smallbarrel.png)     |     ![Large Barrel](./media/Largebarrel.png)     |          ![Different wood types](./media/2largebarrels.png)          |

As seen the small barrel, is 2x2 made from wooden stairs, with the sign placed on the lower right corner.

The large one is 4x4 and consist of a total of: 20 planks, 16 stairs, 5 fence posts, 1 sign in exactly the configuration shown. When correctly made a message in chat will notify the player that they have successfully made a barrel.

knowing when and how long to age a brew for is found out by experimentation through trail and error. (1 year of aging is equal to 1 Minecraft day or 20 minutes real time)

*Note that barrels can be any type of wood, and that the wood type used can matter to the brew put inside to age. 

### Sealing
Don't forget this critical step if you're planning to sell your brews! Sealing your brews makes it so their recipe details are no longer displayed in its lore. So you're not giving out recipes for free! You can make a sealing station with 4 planks and 2 glass bottles in a crafting table.

Just place it down, and put your finished brews in it;s crafting grid for a second or 2. The brew is sealed when there are [brackets] surrounding the stars in the lore. 

## Starter Brews
Below are some simple recipes to help you get started in your brewing career. Some may require custom ingredients you'll have to discover first however.

### Texture pack
Texture ID's are provided below with the list to be used while making a texture pack, allowing players to create a custom texture for each brew and ingredient. 

## Discovering new brews
### Vanilla ingredients
The Vanilla ingredients are items from the base game that can be used in the cauldron and are at least used by 1 recipe. And/or they are used to make a custom ingredient. Meaning that you can find almost all custom ingredients simply by seeing what the outcome is of all the possible vanilla items in the cauldron.

### Custom Ingredients
Custom ingredients are for the most part "Base brews" meaning that they are a result of putting 1 item in the cauldron, waiting 2 minutes or more and taking it out with a bottle.
A small amount of custom ingredients require specific amounts of an item, or require a combination of 2 vanilla items to be made.

### Intermediary results
When trying to discover new brews, something that will help you the most will be the intermediary results you find. These indicate that you've put in the correct collection of items for a brew, and that you should try distilling or aging the brew. Or that you need different amounts of the items you put in, to find the brew they indicate.

### Cauldron Particles
When trying to find the correct cooking time for a brew, the best way is to look at the color of the intermediary result. And wait until the particles above the cauldron turn that exact color. This requires you to watch carefully though, as the particles gradually change color over time.

### Trial and Error
Ultimately though, discovering new brewing recipes is a whole bunch of trial and error, trying out different combinations of ingredients, distilling, aging, wood types, and timings. A master brewer is a patient one.
To help you start out however, we have provided some information below of all brews in the game.
